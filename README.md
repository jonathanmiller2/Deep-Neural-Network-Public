# Deep-Neural-Network-Public
This is a personal deep learning project to demonstrate my own programming skills, and to make money! 

### **To potential employers:**
This is my magnum opus (thus far!) and I believe assembled it best shows my coding style and ability.
The three sections of this project show three facets of my programming skill, which are as follows:

1. Neural Network
  * Core programming principles, such as algorithm design
  * Research and modernity
2. Website
  * Front-end development (HTML and CSS)
  * Back-end development (Node.js)
3. Data Retrieval
  * Databasing and data management
  * Using APIs via HTTP Methods

Feel free to look around! I used no non-essential libraries so the code is all my own.<br/>

#### Neural Network
For those experience with neural networking, the technical attributes are thus:
* Gradient descent optimization scheme
* Leaky RELU activation function (10^-5 inactive multiplier)
* Learning rate scheme: [Stochastic with warm restarts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03983.pdf)
* [Nesterov Momentum](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/)
* Sigmoid normalized inputs
* **100% in Javascript! Full-stack AI development in a single language! No python in sight!**
